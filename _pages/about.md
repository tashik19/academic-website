I am a **Ph.D. student in Computer Science** at **Texas State University**, where I conduct research on **diffusion models**, **time-series generation**, and **intelligent sensor-based systems**.  

My research focuses on leveraging **generative AI** to improve the **reliability, robustness, and interpretability** of time-series models used in **healthcare and human activity analysis**. In particular, I explore how **diffusion-based generative frameworks** can enhance **fall detection systems** by bridging **sensor and skeletal modalities**, enabling safer and more adaptive solutions for **real-world healthcare applications**.  

Beyond diffusion modeling, my broader interests include **multimodal learning**, **latent representation modeling**, and **quantitative evaluation of generative systems**. I am passionate about connecting **theoretical advances in deep learning** with **practical, real-world impact** to improve human safety and well-being.
