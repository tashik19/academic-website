This paper proposes **TransConv-DDPM**, a transformer-convolution hybrid diffusion model designed to generate high-quality synthetic time-series data for healthcare analytics. The model improves diversity and realism while preserving temporal consistency, enabling robust downstream tasks like fall detection and activity recognition.
