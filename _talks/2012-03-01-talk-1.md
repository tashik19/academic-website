I presented our paper titled **"TransConv-DDPM: Enhanced Diffusion Model for Generating Time-Series Data in Healthcare"** at the **IEEE 49th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC 2025)**, held in Toronto, Canada.

The presentation highlighted our proposed **TransConv-DDPM** framework — a transformer–convolution hybrid diffusion model designed to generate high-quality synthetic time-series data for healthcare analytics. The model enhances diversity, realism, and temporal consistency, supporting robust downstream tasks such as fall detection and activity recognition.
