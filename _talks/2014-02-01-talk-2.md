I presented a **poster** on *"TransConv-DDPM: Time-Series Data Generation With Diffusion"* as part of the **CS 7300 Graduate Research course** at **Texas State University** on **December 7, 2024**.

The presentation summarized my research published in *IEEE PULSE (Vol. 16, No. 1, 2025)*, co-authored with **Anne H. H. Ngu**, focusing on synthetic time-series generation for healthcare applications.  
The poster highlighted the design of **TransConv-DDPM**, a diffusion-based generative model that integrates multiscale convolution modules and transformer layers to effectively capture both local and global temporal dynamics in physiological time-series data.

Key results demonstrated that TransConv-DDPM outperformed baseline methods such as **TimeGAN** and standard **DDPM** on benchmark datasets including **Stick Balancing** and **SmartFallMM**, showing superior performance in metrics like **Correlation**, **DTW**, and **FID**.
